The solution involves ensuring that the native modules are correctly linked to your React Native project.  For iOS, this usually involves running pod install within the iOS folder of your project. For Android, it often entails executing the correct build commands within the Android folder and possibly modifying build.gradle files to correctly include native libraries.  Additionally, double-check that the library you're using is compatible with your React Native version and that you've followed all installation instructions carefully.  Here's how to resolve the issue for this specific example:

1. **For iOS:** Navigate to the `ios` directory of your React Native project and run `pod install`.  This will install the necessary native dependencies.
2. **For Android:** Ensure that the native libraries are properly included in your `settings.gradle` and `build.gradle` files.  Clean and rebuild your Android project.
3. **Verify Installation:** After linking, carefully restart the app. Check if the error is fixed.

This error occurs when you are using a library that requires native modules but haven't properly linked them to your React Native project.  This often happens with third-party libraries that interact with device hardware or system functionalities.  The error might manifest differently depending on the specific library and how the linking process failed, but generally, you'll encounter a cryptic error message when trying to use features provided by that library.
